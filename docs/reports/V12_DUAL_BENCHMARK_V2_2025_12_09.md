**Terminal:** Claude 1
**Wallets Tested:** 50
**Valid Dome Data:** 50

## Executive Summary

This benchmark compares two realized PnL definitions against Dome API to prove that
the low pass rate is due to a **definition mismatch**, not a calculation error.

## Conclusion

V12Cash (strict cash flows) aligns better with Dome API than V12Synthetic.

**The synthetic gap represents unredeemed winning shares:**
- V12Synthetic credits these at resolution value
- V12Cash and Dome do NOT credit until actual redemption

This confirms the hypothesis: Dome's low pass rate is a **definition mismatch**, not a calculation bug.
Cascadian can confidently use V12Synthetic for product metrics while understanding the definition difference.
