# Copy-Trading Portfolio - CORRECTED METHODOLOGY

**Generated:** 2025-12-18T20:40:00Z
**Methodology:** V2 ALL-TIME (no 60-day filter)

---

## Critical Methodology Fixes

### Problem Discovered
The original portfolio selection used a **60-day filter** that created **survivorship bias**. Wallets that had massive historical losses but recent wins were incorrectly selected.

### Examples of Bad Selections (OLD methodology)
| Wallet | 60-day P&L | ALL-TIME P&L | Issue |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 0x126b65f5... (Prometheus2) | +$1,272 | **-$10,799** | Massive historical losses hidden |
| 0x010395e4... (DontTrustFakeMedia) | +$2,256 | **-$17,344** | Omega 0.79 = loses more than wins |

### Fixes Applied
1. **NO 60-day filter** - Uses ALL historical data
2. **Pre-computed P&L flags** - Fixed ClickHouse nested aggregate error
3. **Stricter gate criteria** - n_events >= 15, omega >= 1.3

### Results
- **694 candidates** evaluated
- **75 qualified** with positive ALL-TIME P&L
- **356 rejected** with NEGATIVE ALL-TIME P&L (would have been traps!)

## Portfolio Selection Criteria

For copy-trading, we prioritize:
1. **Positive ALL-TIME P&L** (mandatory)
2. **Omega > 1.5** (wins exceed losses by 50%+)
3. **Win rate 50-85%** (realistic, not lucky)
4. **High notional volume** (serious traders, not noise)
5. **Tier A** (CLOB-only, no external activity)

### Selection Rationale

2. **0x006cc834cc09...** - Strong omega (2.64) with $1.2M+ all-time profit. High-conviction trader.

3. **0x1521b47bf0c4...** - Exceptional omega (7.37) with 82.4% win rate. Newer but very consistent.

4. **0x8247f6d658b0...** - Longest history (since Dec 2022), proven track record with 3.82 omega.

## Recommended Allocation ($1,000)

| Tier | Allocation | Wallets |
|------|------------|---------|
| Conservative (omega > 3) | $500 (50%) | #3, #4, #7, #9 |
| Balanced (omega 2-3) | $350 (35%) | #1, #2, #5, #8 |
| Growth (omega < 2) | $150 (15%) | #6, #10 |

## Risk Notes

1. **Knoxgold (0x01baeccca6...)** was excluded despite +$348K all-time because of large unredeemed losing UFC positions

2. **High-volume whales** (top 4 by P&L) have high notional - may be harder to copy due to market impact

3. **All wallets are Tier A** - CLOB-only traders with verifiable on-chain history

---

## Validation Required

Before actual deployment, validate each wallet's P&L against Polymarket UI:
1. Navigate to profile page
2. Confirm ALL-TIME P&L is positive
3. Check for large unredeemed losing positions
