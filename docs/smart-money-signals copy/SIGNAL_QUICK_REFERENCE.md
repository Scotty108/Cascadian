## Risk Rules

1. **Minimum 5 days before resolution** - Closer = less edge
2. **Entry only when SM ahead of crowd** - No edge when they agree
3. **Position sizing: Kelly/4** - Never bet more than 6% per signal
4. **Category matters most** - Same signal, different category = different outcome

---

## Red Flags (DO NOT BET)

- SM and crowd both >80% confident → Market efficient, no edge
- <5 days to resolution → Edge eroded
- Sports category → No consistent pattern
- SM confident but crowd MORE confident → Likely priced in
