TIMESTAMP CRISIS - QUICK SUMMARY
========================================
Date: 2025-11-11
Status: CRITICAL - AWAITING DECISION

THE PROBLEM:
-----------
• tmp_block_timestamps table: EMPTY (was 1.6M rows)
• erc1155_transfers: 196,377 / 206,112 rows (95.28%) have epoch zero timestamps
• RPC fetch of 52,960 blocks: returned 0 timestamps (likely rate limited)

IMPACT:
-------
• 95% of ERC1155 transfer data unusable for time-series analysis
• Trade reconstruction blocked
• PnL calculations affected

RECOVERY OPTIONS:
----------------

OPTION A: ClickHouse Cloud Backup Restore ⭐ RECOMMENDED
• Time: 5-15 minutes
• Risk: LOW
• Success: HIGH (if backup exists)
• Action: Check ClickHouse Cloud console for backups

OPTION B: RPC Refetch with Multi-Provider Strategy 🔄
• Time: 2-4 hours
• Risk: MEDIUM
• Success: MEDIUM-HIGH
• Action: Set up Alchemy + Infura + Public RPCs with retry logic

OPTION C: Partial Recovery ❌ NOT VIABLE
• Coverage: < 1% (only 0.01% of blocks available)

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP:
-------------------
1. Check ClickHouse Cloud backup availability
2. If backup exists: Restore tmp_block_timestamps → Run enrichment
3. If no backup: Prepare Option B (gather RPC keys, run robust refetch script)

FULL ANALYSIS:
-------------
See: /Users/scotty/Projects/Cascadian-app/TIMESTAMP_CRISIS_ANALYSIS.md

DECISION REQUIRED FROM USER:
---------------------------
□ Check ClickHouse Cloud backups
□ Report backup status: "backup exists" or "no backup"
□ Approve recovery path (A or B)
