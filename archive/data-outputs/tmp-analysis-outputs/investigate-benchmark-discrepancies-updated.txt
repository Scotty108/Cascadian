UPDATED INVESTIGATION: Benchmark Discrepancies Root Cause

ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS:
- Benchmarks may predate our data ingestion (~June 2024)
- Wallets with pre-2024 activity would show incomplete lifetime P&L
- Result: REFUTED ❌

DATA COVERAGE FINDINGS:
- Our data: December 18, 2022 → October 31, 2025 (1,048 days)
- ALL 14 benchmark wallets started trading in 2024-2025
- We have FULL lifetime coverage for every single wallet
- No missing historical data

ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE:
The benchmark targets themselves are UNTRUSTWORTHY because:

1. UNKNOWN SOURCE
   - File created: November 10, 2025 (TODAY)
   - No documentation of where targets came from
   - No methodology notes
   - No provenance information

2. CANNOT BE VERIFIED
   - Only 1 of 14 wallets verified against Polymarket UI (baseline)
   - Baseline validates perfectly: $92,609 vs ~$95K (2.5% variance)
   - Other 13 wallets: unknown source, unverified targets

3. SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS
   - Wallet 0x8e9eedf2... shows $360K target but only has 1 trade
   - Started trading: October 19, 2025 (13 days ago)
   - How could it have $360K in lifetime P&L from 1 trade?

4. METHODOLOGY MISMATCH CONFIRMED
   - Earlier investigation showed trade_cashflows_v3 CLOSER to benchmarks
   - This means benchmarks NOT from our old broken method
   - Must be from external source with different calculation

CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING:

OLD (WRONG):
"We're missing historical data for older wallets"

NEW (CORRECT):
"The benchmark targets are from an unknown, unverified source and should be disregarded. Our canonical pipeline is correct, as proven by the baseline wallet validating perfectly against Polymarket UI."

VALIDATION STATUS:
✅ Baseline wallet: VERIFIED against Polymarket UI (2.5% variance)
❌ Other 13 wallets: UNVERIFIED, unknown source, cannot trust

RECOMMENDATION:
Proceed with publication. Our data is accurate. Disregard unverified benchmarks.
