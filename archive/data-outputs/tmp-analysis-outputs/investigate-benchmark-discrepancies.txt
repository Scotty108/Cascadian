CRITICAL CONCERN: Large P&L Discrepancies

OBSERVATIONS:

1. BASELINE WALLET (0xcce2b7c7...58b):
   - Target: $94,730
   - Actual: $92,609
   - Delta: -2.2% ✅ GOOD - matches Polymarket UI

2. EXTREME SWINGS (concerning):
   - 0x7f3c8979... : +$179K → -$4.3M (-2489%)
   - 0x1489046c... : +$138K → -$1.6M (-1281%)
   - 0xeb6f0a13... : +$125K → +$1.9M (+1430%)
   
3. WALLET NOT FOUND:
   - 0x8e9eedf2... : $360K → $0 (-100%)

POSSIBLE CAUSES:

A. TIME PERIOD MISMATCH
   - Benchmarks may be snapshot from specific date
   - Our query is "lifetime" (all time)
   - Wallets continued trading after benchmark date

B. DATA SOURCE DIFFERENCE
   - Benchmarks may be from different data source
   - Or different filtering criteria

C. ACTUAL DATA ISSUES
   - Some wallets may have bad data in trade_cashflows_v3
   - Need to verify against Polymarket UI for these wallets

NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
1. Check when benchmark targets were created
2. Query Polymarket UI for a few extreme-deviation wallets
3. Verify if trade_cashflows_v3 data is correct for these wallets
