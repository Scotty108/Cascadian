RESOLUTION SOURCE COMPARISON

vw_resolutions_unified          |    157,222 |       157,222 |  24.83%
  └─ warehouse source           |    157,222 |       157,222 | 100.00%

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. TRUE COVERAGE: 24.83% (56,575 / 227,838 markets)

2. Report B (55.8%) was WRONG because:
   - Counted raw resolution rows instead of matched markets
   - Included unresolved API data (resolved=0, payout=NULL)
   - Did not validate joins with actual traded markets

3. ALL resolution data comes from 'warehouse' source
   - vw_resolutions_unified is 100% warehouse
   - API backfill has 0 valid resolutions (all NULL payouts)
   - Blockchain backfill has 0 overlap with traded markets

4. Volume coverage WORSE than count coverage
   - 24.83% of markets have resolutions
   - Only 14.25% of trading volume has resolutions
   - High-volume markets are missing resolutions (P&L impact)

CRITICAL ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue                           | Severity | Impact
--------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------
API data all unresolved         | CRITICAL | 127K markets with NULL payouts
Blockchain backfill incomplete  | HIGH     | Only 176 rows, 0 overlap
100% warehouse dependency       | HIGH     | No source diversity
Volume coverage gap             | CRITICAL | Big markets missing resolutions

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMMEDIATE:
1. Accept 24.83% as official coverage number
2. Investigate warehouse source data quality
3. Fix API backfill (130K rows but 0 valid resolutions)

SHORT-TERM:
4. Prioritize high-volume markets for resolution backfill
5. Build blockchain resolution pipeline
6. Implement multi-source resolution strategy

LONG-TERM:
7. Monitor coverage by volume, not just count
8. Build automated resolution refresh pipeline
9. Implement resolution quality validation
