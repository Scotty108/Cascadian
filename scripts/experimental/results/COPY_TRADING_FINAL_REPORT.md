## Executive Summary

After analyzing 200 candidate wallets using pre-computed metrics and verifying top performers via Playwright, **I found ONE wallet that is truly copy-tradable:**

### The Winner: `0x4044798f1d60d92369c86cf5b6f1e497e2818de5`

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|

## Why Other Top Wallets Were Rejected

### #1 @isunou (0x22b57908...)
- **Problem:** All trades at 97-99.9% prices
- **Entry prices:** 99¢, 99.5¢, 99.8¢, 99.9¢
- **Verdict:** ARBER - impossible to copy with 12s delay

### #2 @BKKSL33 (0xd2020940...)
- **Problem:** High-frequency arb/lottery style
- **Entry prices:** 99.8-99.9¢ and 0.1-1¢ (extremes)
- **Verdict:** NOT COPYABLE - too fast, too extreme

### #3-#15 (Various)
- Most had high win rates but extreme entry prices (>85¢)
- Many are arbers exploiting 0.1-1¢ lottery tickets
- Our 12-second execution delay makes them uncopyable

### Verified Closed Positions (All Wins)

| Position | Entry | Return | Verdict |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| BTC won't hit $95k | **11¢** | +809% | COPYABLE |
| BTC won't dip to $80k | **58¢** | +77% | COPYABLE |
| Trump releases Epstein files Dec 22 | **20¢** | +296% | COPYABLE |
| Trump releases Epstein files Dec 31 | **71¢** | +40% | COPYABLE |
| BTC won't hit $100k | **46¢** | +5% | COPYABLE |
| Colbert not in Epstein files | **1¢** | +4,625% | LOTTERY (small) |
| Michael Jackson in Epstein files | **60¢** | +19% | COPYABLE |
| Avatar box office 90-101m | **24¢** | +51% | COPYABLE |

### Trading Style
- **Thesis-driven:** BTC price targets, political events (Epstein files)
- **Entry price range:** 11¢ - 89¢ (mostly 20-71¢)
- **Size:** $2,200 - $17,460 per position
- **Frequency:** ~2-3 trades per week (copyable pace)

## Simulation Results

Using pre-computed metrics formula:
```
Expected ROI = (WinRate × AvgWin) - ((1-WinRate) × |AvgLoss|)
             = (0.543 × 2.89) - (0.457 × 0.81)
             = 1.57 - 0.37
             = +119.9% per $1 bet
```

### If You Copied Every Trade with $100:
- **64 positions × $100 = $6,400 invested**
- **Expected return: $6,400 × 1.199 = $7,674**
- **Net profit: ~$7,674**

## Leaderboard (Filtered for Copyability)

After removing arbers (>85¢ entries), here are the TRUE copy-tradable wallets:

| Rank | Wallet | Win Rate | Exp. ROI | Actual PnL | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| **1** | 0x4044798f... | 54% | +119.9% | $34,647 | **RECOMMENDED** |
| 2 | 0x92d8a88f... | 64% | +152.1% | $33,641 | Check entries |
| 3 | 0xd37174b4... | 64% | +179.9% | $7,680 | Check entries |
| 4 | 0x27345a76... | 68% | +41.6% | $91,937 | Check entries |

## Copyability Constraints Applied

1. **Entry price < 85¢** - 12-second delay prevents high-price arbs
2. **Trades per day < 50** - Human-copyable pace
3. **CLOB-only** - No splits/merges to replicate
4. **PnL Confidence: HIGH** - Trust the numbers

## Recommendation

**Copy `0x4044798f1d60d92369c86cf5b6f1e497e2818de5`**

- Best combination of copyable entry prices + proven track record
- Clear thesis-driven approach (not random)
- 3.6x win/loss asymmetry means wins are much bigger than losses
- Kelly criterion suggests 41% of bankroll is optimal

## Next Steps

1. Set up alerts for this wallet's new positions
2. When they buy at <85¢, copy with equal or smaller size
3. Track performance over next 30 days
4. Re-run edge detection monthly to find new candidates
