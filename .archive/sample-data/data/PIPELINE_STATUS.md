# Data Pipeline Status - October 27, 2025

## 沁ｯ Mission: Fix Market_ID Gap to Enable Category Attribution

**Critical Blocker**: 86% of trades (2.1M out of 2.5M) are missing market_id, capping wallet coverage at ~14% and completely blocking category-level P&L attribution.

**Solution**: Two-phase approach:
1. **Immediate**: Batch lookup of 44,047 missing condition_ids via Polymarket API (READ-ONLY)
2. **Permanent**: Fix ingestion pipeline to populate market_id at insert time

---

## 沒 Current Status (as of 11:45 AM)

### Background Job 1: Dimension Build 笨 Running
- **Progress**: 2,900/4,961 markets (58.5%)
- **Enrichment**: 70.8% of markets have event_id and category data
- **Events fetched**: 50,100 total events from Polymarket
- **Condition mappings**: 131,191 condition竊弾vent associations built
- **Output files** (in progress):
  - `data/markets_dim_seed.json` - Market dimension with event_id, category, tags
  - `data/events_dim_seed.json` - Event dimension with category hierarchy

### Background Job 2: Market_ID Backfill 笨 Running
- **Progress**: 3,500/44,047 conditions (7.9%)
- **Success rate**: 100.0% (every API call returning valid market_id)
- **ETA**: ~6.7 hours
- **Rate limiting**: 5 parallel workers, 600ms delay (~50 req/min, under 100/min limit)
- **Output file** (in progress):
  - `data/market_id_lookup_results.jsonl` - Line-delimited JSON with condition竊知arket mappings

## 笨 Completed Tasks

### 1. Watchlist Auto-Population Enhanced
**File**: `lib/services/watchlist-auto-populate.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added dimension table loading and caching
- Automatic lookup of category, tags, event_id for each market
- Category and tags now first-class fields in watchlist entries
- JSONL audit log includes category and tags
- Gracefully handles missing dimension data

**Impact**: When autonomous trading is enabled, all watchlist entries will automatically include category context for filtering and analysis.

### 2. Finalization Scripts Created
**Purpose**: Generate final artifacts once background jobs complete

#### Script 1: `scripts/finalize-market-id-lookup.ts`
- Converts JSONL to clean JSON format
- Filters out null or "unknown" market_ids
- Validates all mappings
- Provides success rate statistics

#### Script 2: `scripts/generate-wallet-category-breakdown.ts`
- For each wallet, calculates P&L by category
- Computes win rate by category
- Counts resolved markets per category
- Identifies predominant side (YES/NO)
- Generates human-readable summaries like:
  > "Wallet 0xb744...c3f2 has $9,012 realized profit with 80% coverage. Most of that is in Elections and Earnings, mostly on the NO side."

#### Script 3: `scripts/finalize-all.ts` (Master Runner)
- Checks prerequisites (both jobs complete)
- Runs all finalization steps in sequence
- Generates final summary report
- Shows wallet coverage distribution
- Provides sample wallet summaries

### 3. Progress Monitoring
**File**: `scripts/check-progress.ts`

Monitors both background jobs with:
- Real-time progress percentages
- Enrichment rates
- Success/failure counts
- ETA calculations
- Projected trade coverage after backfill

**Usage**: `npx tsx scripts/check-progress.ts`

---

## 沒 Next Steps (When Jobs Complete)

### Immediate (Estimated: ~7 hours from now)

1. **Run finalization**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/finalize-all.ts
   ```

   This will generate:
   - `data/market_id_lookup_results.json` - Full condition竊知arket mappings (~44K entries)
   - `data/wallet_category_breakdown.json` - Per-wallet category P&L (548 wallets)
   - Updated `data/markets_dim_seed.json` with complete enrichment
   - Updated `data/events_dim_seed.json` with full event hierarchy

2. **Review outputs**:
   - Check success rates (expect >95% for both jobs)
   - Verify top categories make sense (Elections, Crypto, Sports, etc.)
   - Review wallet coverage distribution (how many wallets have >80% coverage?)

3. **Apply backfill to ClickHouse** (when ready):
   ```sql
   -- Update trades_raw with resolved market_ids
   -- Use market_id_lookup_results.json as source
   ```

### Strategic (Next Week)

1. **Fix ingestion pipeline**:
   - See `data/INGESTION_FIX_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation plan
   - Add condition_id竊知arket_id resolver to ingestion
   - Prevent future gaps from accumulating

2. **Enable category-level features**:
   - Wallet skill by category (Sports, Politics, Crypto)
   - Category-based signal filtering
   - Real-time category P&L attribution
   - Category-aware watchlist auto-population

3. **Test autonomous trading**:
   - Set `AUTONOMOUS_TRADING_ENABLED=true` in .env.local
   - Monitor watchlist auto-population with category filters
   - Verify category data flows through to execution

## 沁ｯ Success Metrics

### Before (Current State)
- Wallet coverage: ~14% average
- Category attribution: 0% (completely blocked)
- Trades with market_id: 345,959 / 2,455,151 (14%)

### After (Projected)
- Wallet coverage: **>80%** average (with backfill applied)
- Category attribution: **>95%** (full category hierarchy available)
- Trades with market_id: **>2M** / 2,455,151 (>80%)

### Impact
- **Product**: Can now show "Most profit in Elections, mostly NO side"
- **Strategy**: Can filter signals by category performance
- **Risk**: Can monitor category exposure and concentration
- **Analytics**: Can generate category-level P&L reports

## 泅ｨ Important Notes

### READ-ONLY Mode
All current work is READ-ONLY. No ClickHouse updates have been made. The backfill data exists only in JSON files. This allows full validation before applying changes.

### Rate Limiting
Polymarket API has 100 req/min limit. Current backfill uses:
- 5 parallel workers
- 600ms delay per request
- ~50 req/min effective (50% safety margin)

### Critical Invariants
- 128x share inflation bug fix MUST remain in place
- Coverage % must always be displayed with P&L
- Category is now a first-class field (not optional metadata)

### Known Issues
- ~4K markets still don't have event associations (will show as "Uncategorized")
- Some old/deprecated markets may not resolve via API
- Early entries/late entries timing data requires market creation timestamps (not yet available)

**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025, 11:45 AM
**Next Checkpoint**: Run `npx tsx scripts/check-progress.ts` in 1-2 hours
**Estimated Completion**: ~6-7 hours from now (both jobs finish)
