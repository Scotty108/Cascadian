================================================================================
                         RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

ZERO RISK ITEMS (78K):
  ✓ Root diagnostic files are isolated
  ✓ Not referenced by build system
  ✓ No code dependencies
  ✓ Safe to archive immediately

LOW RISK ITEMS (4.6GB):
  ✓ Investigation/analysis artifacts
  ✓ Not used in production
  ✓ Can be regenerated if needed
  ✓ No active CI/CD dependencies
  ✓ Safe after basic verification

MEDIUM RISK ITEMS (545M):
  ⚠️ ClickHouse binary
  ⚠️ Requires verification that:
     - Goldsky migration is complete
     - No local dev instances needed
     - Managed service is fully operational
  ⚠️ Can be kept if unsure

PRODUCTION CODE RISK: ZERO
  ✓ No production code affected
  ✓ Build process unimpacted
  ✓ All critical files retained
  ✓ Infrastructure unchanged


================================================================================
                      CRITICAL SAFETY NOTES
================================================================================

⚠️  NEVER DELETE THESE:
    - .env.local (contains production secrets)
    - /scripts (2,294 files include active pipeline)
    - /sql (DDL schemas - essential references)
    - /.claude (Claude Code configuration - ACTIVE)
    - /app, /lib, /components (production code)

✓  ALWAYS DO THESE:
    - Create backup of .archive/ to external storage
    - Verify archival before deleting source
    - Ensure git status is clean before cleanup
    - Use multi-worker parallelism (8 workers)
    - Enable crash & stall protection
    - Generate SHA256 manifest for verification
    - Test on subset (50 files) before full run


================================================================================
                       RECOMMENDED APPROACH
================================================================================

Per CLAUDE.md standards:

1. ✓ Use MULTI-WORKER parallelism (8 workers)
2. ✓ Enable CRASH PROTECTION (rsync with verification)
3. ✓ Create STALL PROTECTION (verify copies complete)
4. ✓ Generate CHECKSUM MANIFEST (SHA256 of all files)
5. ✓ TEST ON SUBSET FIRST (50 files before full run)

                         NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE:
  1. Read CLEANUP_INDEX.md (3-minute overview)
  2. Read CLEANUP_VISUAL_SUMMARY.txt (2-minute breakdown)
  3. Review CLEANUP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (10-minute guide)

BEFORE CLEANUP:
  □ Goldsky migration timeline confirmed (for ClickHouse decision)
  □ No active backfill jobs depend on these files
  □ Team confirmed reference reports aren't needed
  □ Created backup destination for .archive/
  □ git status is clean
  □ .env.local is backed up securely
  □ Verified /scripts and /sql are being kept

IMPLEMENTATION:
  1. Start with Phase 1 (zero risk, frees 1.1 GB)
  2. Wait for Goldsky confirmation
  3. Proceed with Phase 2-3
  4. Review ClickHouse situation for Phase 4
